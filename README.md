# Government Arts & Science College – Event Countdown and Announcement Web Portal

## Description
Static landing page showing an event countdown and basic college information. Prepared for project submission.

## Files
- index.html
- favicon.png
- README.md

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in a browser or run: `python -m http.server 8000` and open http://localhost:8000

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (step-by-step)
1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g., `college-event-portal`).
2. From your project folder run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - College event portal"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**, select branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, then save.
4. After a few minutes, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Notes
- The page is static; no backend needed.
- If you want, I can prepare the GitHub repo (I will provide commands you can copy/paste).
